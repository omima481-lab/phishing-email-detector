# Phishing Email Detector (AI Project)

This project uses Machine Learning to detect phishing emails.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing

## How it works
The model is trained on examples of phishing and safe emails.  
It converts text into numerical data and uses a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a new email is malicious or safe.

## Example Output
The program allows the user to enter email text and returns:
- ⚠️ Phishing
- ✅ Safe
